    <h2>Welcome to my bookshelf...</h2>
    <img src="images/books.jpg" alt="Books set us free">
    <p>Books are indeed a necessity more than a hobby I believe. They pave a way for us into the unknown paradise or a world of our imagination. Books takes us places and enable us to live there and escape the reality that surrounds us. Sometime they change the mere and abstract concept of what is reality for us.
      They make us believe in many worldly as well as imaginative aspects of our existence and life. The life which has so much to show us could also be explored in the bookshelf or in the world of books. They set us free and let our thoughts meet the words and sets wings to our imaginative sea of possibilities.
